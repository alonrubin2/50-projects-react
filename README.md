this project is a translation project.


I've started a course in Udemy which titled "50 Projects in 50 Days" by Brad Trasersy

{{{
    the link to the course - https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/

    this course shows many neat tricks and really cool design concepts and i cannot recommend it enough!

However, this course is focused on HTML, CSS and JS which are great for static sites, but not necessarily
for SPAs and React.js.
So I've decided to start this project to translate the snippets and concepts in the course to react components all linked to a central app and landing page.
